💡 Idea Name: LearnFlow AI
A GenAI-powered learning guide that turns any topic or class notes into a complete, interactive learning journey.

🧠 What It Does:
Students input a topic they're studying (e.g. “Photosynthesis” or “Limits in Calculus”) — or upload their class notes — and LearnFlow AI transforms it into a personalized, structured learning experience:

🧩 1. Breaks Down the Topic into a Flowchart (Concept Map)
Uses NLP + semantic mapping to split the topic into core ideas & sub-concepts

Visualizes them as a connected graph:

e.g., “Photosynthesis → Light Reactions → ATP/NADPH → Calvin Cycle → Glucose”

Each node is clickable and opens a mini-lesson

🧠 Tech: GPT + Mermaid.js or D3.js for flowchart visualization

🎞️ 2. Provides a Video + Summary for Each Concept
Uses YouTube Transcript API or YouTube search + summary generation

AI summarizes the video or creates an explanation from scratch

Option to choose “Simple”, “Academic”, or “Analogy-based” explanations

🧠 Tech: GPT + YouTube search API + YouTube transcript + summarizer

🧠 3. Generates Flashcards for Every Sub-Concept
AI creates Q&A flashcards from the lesson content or your notes

Includes spaced repetition or progress tracking

Option to export to Quizlet

🧠 Tech: GPT Q&A generation + simple flashcard UI

📝 4. Builds a Custom Practice Test
Once the student finishes the flowchart, they can take a mini test

AI builds MCQs, true/false, short answers

Gives feedback, hints, and explanations

🧠 Tech: GPT + custom prompt templates for different question types

✨ Why It’s Different (and Awesome)
Feature	What Makes It Special
✅ Flowchart learning	Students see how ideas connect, not just isolated facts
✅ Multimedia	Combines video, notes, and interactive flashcards
✅ Fully automated	Upload notes or type a topic → everything is generated
✅ Active learning	Practice test + flashcards reinforce understanding
✅ Personalized	Picks videos, simplifies complex topics, adjusts based on progress
🧪 Example User Flow:
Student: “I’m learning ‘Cell Division’”

Bot: Generates concept map:

Mitosis → Phases → Key Terms

Click: “Metaphase”

Short explanation + video + 5 flashcards

After completing map → “Take Practice Test”

Score: 8/10 → Bot suggests reviewing “Telophase” again

🛠️ Tech Stack Suggestion
Frontend: React + Tailwind (UI), D3.js (flowcharts), Flip Card UI

Backend: Node.js + Express

AI: OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude API (flow breakdown, summaries, flashcards, tests)

APIs: YouTube Search API, YouTube Transcript, Firebase (storage/user tracking)
